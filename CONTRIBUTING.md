# Contributing

Contributions are welcome — especially bug reports from anyone who has run this
against **real warehouse data**. The bundled sample dataset is synthetic and
well-behaved; yours won't be, and that's where the interesting failures live.

Good first contributions:

- Run `./run.sh` on your OS and open an issue for anything that didn't work
- Import your own CSV and report what the importer choked on
- Add a routing test case for a question that went to the wrong agent
  (`tests/test_intent_routing.py`)
- Anything on the [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md)

## Before you open a PR

```bash
pytest                                   # tests must pass
cd src/ui/web && npx tsc --noEmit        # TypeScript must compile
```

## Pull Requests

Developer workflow for code contributions is as follows:

1. Developers must first [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the upstream this repository.

2. Git clone the forked repository and push changes to the personal fork.

3. Once the code changes are staged on the fork and ready for review, a Pull Request (PR) can be requested to merge the changes from a branch of the fork into a selected branch of upstream.

4. There is no CI pipeline yet, so PRs are merged after manual review and
   testing. Describe what you tested and on which OS and Python version.

## Signing Your Work

We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted. To sign off on a commit, use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

```bash
$ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
```

This will append the following to your commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```
